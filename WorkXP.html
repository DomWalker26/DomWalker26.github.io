<p>Worked on projects and workshops involving soldering, wiring, and coding</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:3px">Internship Student, AT&T, August 2022 - Current</p>

<p style="margin-top:3px">
<li>Raspberry Pi: Conducted a project to create a script to make a LED light blink using an Raspberry Pi and blank breadboard. It was a success and provided useful knowledge on how to wire and code.</li>
<li>LED Sign: During Q4 Lone Star Labs wanted to develop a workshop that would allow TDPs to learn how to wire, solder, and code an Arduino Uno.</li>
<li>Soldering: In the Lone Star Labs, a considerable number of things need to be soldered, so it was decided that at least a few people knew how to solder, so there were practice runs teaching TDPs proper soldering techniques.</li>
<li>Meetings: Being able to sit in on meeting provided useful information on how to conduct oneself in one. what goes on during the meetings, and a preview into what is expect in the following weeks and months.</li>
<li>Creating User Manuals: Knowing how to properly operate equipment in Lone Star Labs is very important, so there have been user manuals made to inform TDâ€™ on how to properly operate such equipment as the soldering iron, and the 3D printer.</li>
